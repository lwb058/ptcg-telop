/*
 * PTCG Telop - Custom User Styles
 *
 * HOW TO USE:
 * 1. This file is for you to add your own custom styles. It will NOT be overwritten by future updates.
 * 2. To change colors, copy a variable from `common.css` into the `:root` block below and change its value.
 * 3. You can also add your own custom CSS rules outside the `:root` block.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 * To change the main background color of the player panels to a dark grey, you would add:
 *
 * :root {
 *     --color-bg-panel: #2c2c2c;
 * }
 *
 * To make the player name text yellow, you would add:
 *
 * :root {
 *     --text-light: #ffeb3b;
 * }
 *
