# PTCG-Telop

`PTCG-Telop` is a real-time graphics package for Pokémon TCG live streams, based on the [NodeCG](https://www.nodecg.dev/) framework.

It allows for real-time management of player board states (HP, damage, energy, tools, special conditions, etc.) and displays them as an overlay on the stream. Designed with operational safety as a top priority, it uses a workflow where all operations are first queued as a "draft" and then applied to the "live" screen in a batch after confirmation.

## Main Features

-   **Detailed Board Management for Each Player**: Individually manage each player's Active and Benched Pokémon.
-   **Batch Operations via Master Control Panel**: Efficiently perform actions like attaching energy or calculating damage for multiple Pokémon.
-   **Safe Broadcasting**: A two-step "draft" and "live" update system prevents operational mistakes from being immediately reflected on the live broadcast.
-   **Card Database Generation via Python Scripts**: Automatically extracts necessary card information from deck lists to build a database.
-   **Flexible State Management**: Flexibly set damage, extra HP, energy, tools, and special conditions (like Poison, Burn, Sleep, etc.).

```

-   **`assets/ptcg-telop/`**: A place to put background images, videos, etc., used in the stream.
-   **`dashboard/`**: The files for the control panels accessed at `http://localhost:9090`.
-   **`graphics/`**: The graphic screen files to be imported into software like OBS.
-   **`python/`**: Scripts for fetching card information from deck codes and generating the database.

## Prerequisites

The following software must be installed to run this bundle.

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Tested on v22.19.0 LTS)
-   [NodeCG](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/installing) (including `nodecg-cli`)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Tested on v3.13)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional. Used for project updates)

## Installation

1.  **Set up NodeCG** (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    # Install NodeCG in a location of your choice
    git clone https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg.git
    cd nodecg
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Clone the PTCG-Telop Bundle**:
    Clone this repository into the `bundles` folder in your NodeCG root directory.
    ```bash
    cd bundles
    git clone https://github.com/lwb058/ptcg-telop.git
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Return to the NodeCG root directory and use `nodecg-cli` to install the bundle's dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd ..
    nodecg-cli install ptcg-telop
    ```

4.  **Place Assets (Image/Video Files)**:
    This bundle uses image and video files for backgrounds, evolution animations, etc. These are not included in the repository and must be downloaded separately.
    1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/lwb058/ptcg-telop/releases) page of this repository.
    2.  Download the asset package (e.g., `assets_v1.0-beta.zip`) from the latest release.
    3.  Unzip the downloaded file and place all its contents into the `nodecg/assets/ptcg-telop/` directory. (If the `assets/ptcg-telop` directory does not exist, please create it).

5.  **Set up Python Environment**:
    Navigate to the bundle's `python` directory and install the required libraries.
    ```bash
    cd bundles/ptcg-telop/python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` does not exist, please manually install the libraries imported in `card_utils_jp.py` or `extract_deck_cards_jp.py` (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`).*

## Usage

1.  **Start NodeCG**:
    Run the following command in the NodeCG root directory.
    ```bash
    nodecg start
    ```

2.  **Access the Dashboard**:
    Open `http://localhost:9090` in a web browser.
    A tab named `ptcg-telop` will appear, giving you access to the various control panels (Master Control, Player L/R, etc.).

3.  **Basic Operation**:
    -   **Set Deck in Player Panel**:
        1.  Obtain a "Deck Code" for the deck you want to use from a site like the [official Pokémon TCG Deck Construction page](https://www.pokemon-card.com/deck/).
        2.  Enter the deck code into the `DeckID` input field in the Player Panel and press the "Set" button.
        3.  The system will automatically fetch the card information and build/update the database.
        4.  You can then select Pokémon from the drop-down menus to place them on the board.
    -   **Master Control Panel**: Perform batch operations like damage calculation or energy attachment on selected Pokémon.
    -   **Operational Flow**: All operations are first added to a draft queue. They are reflected on the live screen only when the `Apply` button is pressed. They can be discarded with the `Discard` button.

4.  **Stream Software Setup (OBS, etc.)**:
    NodeCG's graphics are composed of multiple layers. Please add the following URLs as "Browser Sources" in your streaming software (like OBS).

    For optimal display, it is recommended to arrange the sources in the following order in your OBS source list (top is frontmost):

    1.  **Card Display Layer**: `http://localhost:9090/bundles/ptcg-telop/graphics/card.html`
    2.  **Extra Bench Layer**: `http://localhost:9090/bundles/ptcg-telop/graphics/extra.html`
    3.  **Main Board Layer**: `http://localhost:9090/bundles/ptcg-telop/graphics/main.html`

## Notes

-   **Execution Directory**: The `nodecg` command must be run from the NodeCG **root directory**.
-   **Database**: The database is generated automatically by setting a deck code in the Player Panel. No manual operation is needed.
-   **Operational Flow**: The basic workflow of this system is: "Set individual states in the Player Panel" -> "Select and perform batch operations in the Master Panel" -> "Apply/Discard in the Master Panel".
